# Elevator Challenge

Your task is to create a console application in C# using OOP principles that simulates the movement of elevators, with
the goal being to move people as efficiently as possible.

### The console application should provide the following features:
1. show the status of the elevators, including which floor they are on, whether they are moving and in which direction,
and how many people they are carrying
2. provides a way to interact with the elevators, including calling them to a specific floor and setting the number of
people waiting on each floor

### The console application should be able to offer the following:
1. support for multiple floors
2. support for multiple elevators

Given a pool of elevators, the program should send the nearest available elevator to that person.

Allow a weight limit, expressed as a number of people, to be imposed on the elevators. You can assume
every elevator in the simulation has the same weight limit.
